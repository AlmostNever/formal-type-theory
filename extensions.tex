\section{Extensions of the Theory}
\label{sec:extensions}

In this section we take a look in different extensions that we could add to
our theory without having to go through the sanity theorem all over again.
Remark that without these extensions our type theory would remain empty as there
are no base types.

The way we proceed is simple, if we add elements of syntax and rules, we don't
have to redo the proof entirely, we only have to deal with the new cases it
brings in the induction as well as reproving all inversion lemmata
(this explains why we are so careful in not using inversion inside the sanity
proof without explicitely refering to it as an external lemma).
